# Argentum Compressor

This tool compresses asset folders (images, sounds, interfaces, maps, etc.) for use in the [Argentum Online](https://github.com/ao-org) ecosystem. It wraps custom compression logic with a simple CLI interface and is suitable for automation via Jenkins or other CI/CD systems.

```

**Parameters:**

- `-i`: Path to the folder containing uncompressed resources
- `-o`: Path where compressed files will be saved
- `-p`: Password used to encrypt or tag the resource files

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The compressor CLI is implemented in [`argentum_compressor.cpp`](https://github.com/ao-org/argentum_compressor/blob/main/argentum_compressor.cpp). It:

- Parses command line arguments
- Validates input/output/password parameters
- Recursively processes all files in the input directory
- Compresses valid files and saves them to the output directory

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Subfolders are supported and will be included recursively.
- Compression algorithm is internal to the compiled binary.
- Passwords are passed as plain text. Do not expose sensitive keys in public environments.
